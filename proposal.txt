1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?

    This app will allow users to search for cocktails based on ingredients, name, category, and other criteria, and save their favorite cocktails to their
    account.

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?

    People who like cocktails and finding new recipes.

3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet,
which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain

    I plan on using data from the cocktail db API.
    
4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
a. What does your database schema look like?
    There will be a Users table that stores a user's username, password (hashed), email, and profile picture. 
    In addition, there will be a drink table that has an id, drink name, and drink details obtained from the API
    There will also be a users_drinks table that tracks the relationship between these two.

b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
    The API has certain features like multi-ingredient cocktail search and others that require a Patreon subscription, so I'll be challenged to try
    and use only the free features.

c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
    Yes, user passwords. 

d. What functionality will your app include?
    Cocktail search and browse, profile creation, and profile pages with a list of saved cocktails

e. What will the user flow look like?
    The user can search the database for cocktails without an account, and if they make an account they can then save those recipes

f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch
goals?
    Friends list? Various different methods of sorting cocktails?
